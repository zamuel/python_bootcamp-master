# Python Programming for Beginners
<p>All files included for "Python Programming for Beginners" book.</p>

### Description
<p>
Immerse yourself in learning Python and introductory data analytics with this book’s 
project-based approach. Through the structure of a 10-week coding bootcamp course, you’ll 
learn key concepts and gain hands-on experience through weekly projects.
</p>

<p>
Each chapter in this book is presented as a full week of topics, with Monday through 
Thursday covering specific concepts, leading up to Friday, when you are challenged to 
create a project using the skills learned throughout the week. Topics include Python basics 
and essential intermediate concepts such as list comprehension, generators and iterators, 
understanding algorithmic complexity, and data analysis with pandas. From beginning to end, 
this book builds up your abilities through exercises and challenges, culminating in your 
solid understanding of Python.
</p>

<p>
Challenge yourself with the intensity of a coding bootcamp experience or learn at your own 
pace. With this hands-on learning approach, you will gain the skills you need to jumpstart 
a new career in programming or further your current one as a software developer.
</p>

### What you will learn
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Understand beginning and more advanced concepts of the Python language</li>
		<li>Be introduced to data analysis using pandas, the Python Data Analysis Library</li>
		<li>Walk through the process of interviewing and answering technical questions</li>
		<li>Create real-world applications with the Python language</li>
		<li>Learn how to use the Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, and the Python Shell</li>
	</ul>
</p>


## Week_01: Getting Started
<p>
The first week of any course is always slow. It will encompass setting up
your environment, information about the book itself and python, terminal
commands, how to use the tools you’ve downloaded and eventually end in
creating a small 7-10-line project. Now the project will be basic but will
incorporate concepts that readers won’t understand yet. The reason for
this is to get you to see the power of Python in action, which will create a
desire to read further.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Monday:</b> <i>Introduction</i></li>
		<li><b>Tuesday:</b> Setting Up Anaconda and Python</li>
		<li><b>Wednesday:</b> How to Use the Terminal</li>
		<li><b>Thursday:</b> Using Jupyter Notebook</li>
		<li><b>Friday:</b> Creating Your First Program</li>
	</ul>
</p>


## Week_02: Python Basics
<p>
This week begins the readers journey into becoming a Python
programmer. They will begin to understand basic syntax, what kinds of
data types there are, how to save information into variables, and how to
manipulate strings. The Friday project session will take all these lessons
and walk the reader through making a receipt printing program that neatly
prints out the information saved in variables. The most important lesson
this week will be variables, which will encompass most pages to deeply
explain why they are important and how they are used.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Monday:</b> Comments & Basic Data Types</li>
		<li><b>Tuesday:</b> Variables</li>
		<li><b>Wednesday:</b> Working with Strings</li>
		<li><b>Thursday:</b> String Manipulation</li>
		<li><b>Friday:</b> Creating a Receipt Printing Program</li>
	</ul>
</p>


## Week_03: User Input and Conditionals
<p>
Having already understood how to save information into variables, this
week will begin to make use of the conditional statements. The reader will
have the ability to create a working calculator at the end of the week,
while taking in two numbers and choosing to add, delete, multiply, or
divide them.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Monday:</b> User Input and Type Converting</li>
		<li><b>Tuesday:</b> If Statements</li>
		<li><b>Wednesday:</b> Elif Statements</li>
		<li><b>Thursday:</b> Else Statements</li>
		<li><b>Friday:</b> Creating a Calculator</li>
	</ul>
</p>


## Week_04: Lists and Loops
<p>
Lists are one of the most important concepts of Python, which is why
they are covered over the course of two days. The ability to add, read, and
remove information from lists is pivotal going forward. The other major
concept covered is loops. Again, one of the more important programming
concepts it will be covered over two days with two separate types of loops.
A small working game of Hangman will be created by the end using both
concepts.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Monday:</b> Lists</li>
		<li><b>Tuesday:</b> For Loops</li>
		<li><b>Wednesday:</b> While Loops</li>
		<li><b>Thursday:</b> Working with Lists</li>
		<li><b>Friday:</b> Creating Hangman</li>
	</ul>
</p>


## Week_05: Functions
<p>
This concept has always been one of the tougher for new programmers to
learn, which is why it has a full week by itself. Readers will be able to
understand why functions are useful, how they are used, and when you
should use them. We will then create a full working shopping cart in
Python using functions to add, remove, and show items within the cart.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Monday:</b> Creating and Calling Functions</li>
		<li><b>Tuesday:</b> Parameters</li>
		<li><b>Wednesday:</b> Return Statement</li>
		<li><b>Thursday:</b> Scope</li>
		<li><b>Friday:</b> Creating a Shopping Cart</li>
	</ul>
</p>


## Week_06: Data Collections and Files
<p>
Most of the major concepts have already been covered in previous weeks,
so this week will focus on expanding the reader’s knowledge of data types
and collections in Python, as well as how to use files. We will program a
fake database back-end using Python and CSV files together.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Monday:</b> Dictionaries</li>
		<li><b>Tuesday:</b> Working with Dictionaries</li>
		<li><b>Wednesday:</b> Tuples, Sets, Frozensets</li>
		<li><b>Thursday:</b> Reading and Writing Files</li>
		<li><b>Friday:</b> Creating a User Database with CSV Files</li>
	</ul>
</p>


## Week_07: Object-Oriented Programming
<p>
As hard as functions are to understand, OOP with classes is even tougher.
This full week will cover what OOP is, how and why it is used, and
eventually go over how to create a full-fledged blackjack game together.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Monday:</b> Creating and Instantiating a Class</li>
		<li><b>Tuesday:</b> Attributes</li>
		<li><b>Wednesday:</b> Methods</li>
		<li><b>Thursday:</b> Inheritance</li>
		<li><b>Friday:</b> Creating Blackjack</li>
	</ul>
</p>


## Week_08: Advanced Topics I: Efficiency
<p>
This week begins the advanced section of Python, which will cover items
that your everyday developer uses to make their lives easier. The
understanding of this chapter will help for solidifying the reader’s
computer science skills.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Monday:</b> List Comprehension</li>
		<li><b>Tuesday:</b> Lambda Functions</li>
		<li><b>Wednesday:</b> Map, Filter, and Reduce</li>
		<li><b>Thursday:</b> Recursive Functions and Memoization</li>
		<li><b>Friday:</b> Writing a Binary Search</li>
	</ul>
</p>


## Week_09: Advanced Topics II: Complexity
<p>
This week is the continuation of advanced python concepts and will
cover more topics that a developer has to understand on the job. At the end
of the week several interview tips, questions, and more information will be showcased, 
as well as how to answer them.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Monday:</b> Generators and Iterators</li>
		<li><b>Tuesday:</b> Decorators</li>
		<li><b>Wednesday:</b> Modules</li>
		<li><b>Thursday:</b> Understanding Algorithmic Complexity</li>
		<li><b>Friday:</b> Interview Prep</li>
	</ul>
</p>

## Week_10: Introduction to Data Analysis
<p>
The final chapter covering the Python concepts will give readers an
introduction into what it takes to be a data analysis. It will cover libraries 
used in the industry, as well as APIs. By the end users will be able to
understand how to analyze data using Pandas.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Monday:</b> Virtual Environments and Requests Module</li>
		<li><b>Tuesday:</b> Pandas</li>
		<li><b>Wednesday:</b> Data Visualization</li>
		<li><b>Thursday:</b> Web Scraping</li>
		<li><b>Friday:</b> Website Analysis</li>
	</ul>
